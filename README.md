# Coach Code Reviews App

A super simple app that allows students to enter URLs for pull requests they want reviewed.

Coaches simply enter their name and update the status of the code review to active. When finished, simply select finished and hit update.

- Yellow-highlighted requests mean no one is on the request.
- Blue-highlighting means a coach is actively reviewing the request.
- Green means they have finished reviewing the request.

Put this explainer in the app.
